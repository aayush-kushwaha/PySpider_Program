# Continue is a keyword which is used to skip the current execution and make the control to go for next next iteration
# Example
for i in range(11):
    if i == 4: # If i ==4 then control will skip the current execution when we write continue after that
        continue # Here the control(PVM) will skip the output of above condition
    print(i) # The i value will be printed except for the i condition which is mentioned because we used continue
